"""
sync-effort-issues.py — one-way mirror of this repo's committed effort board
(`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`) into GitHub Issues.

Boards remain the single source of truth. This script is READ-ONLY with
respect to the board: it parses `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` at HEAD and reconciles
GitHub Issues to match it. Agents never write issues directly — only this
script (run by `.github/workflows/effort-issues-sync.yml`) does, so the
mirror can't drift from manual edits made outside the board.

Why the committed mirror and not the machine-local live board
(`/Users/jay/apps/<APP>-EFFORT-LOG.md`): this script runs in GitHub Actions,
which has no access to the operator's Mac filesystem. The committed mirror
updates at every landing (see AGENTS.md's Pre-Commit / Handoff Protocol),
which is the right cadence for owner-visibility notifications — an owner
watching GitHub Issues sees state as of the last merge, not machine-local
edits that haven't landed yet.

Parsing model
--------------
The board is markdown with a small number of top-level (`##`) sections whose
headings vary slightly across repos and over time (e.g. "Planned / Reserved
Before Implementation" vs "Planned / Reserved", with or without emoji). We
classify each section heading by keyword rather than exact match:

  - "planned" / "reserved"        -> bucket "planned"
  - "in progress"                 -> bucket "in-progress"
  - "completed"                   -> bucket "completed"
  - "deployed"                    -> bucket "deployed"
  - anything else (Deployed intro text, "Changelog", etc. that isn't one of
    the four state buckets) is ignored for issue purposes.

Within a recognized section, a top-level bullet (`- ` or `* ` at column 0,
optionally prefixed with an emoji) starts a new item. Any following lines
that are indented continuation text (not a new top-level bullet) are folded
into the same item's body. A bare "(none)" / "(n/a ...)" / "(seeded empty
...)" placeholder bullet is skipped — it documents an empty section, not a
real item.

Item identity
-------------
Each item gets a stable key derived from a SHA1 hash of its *normalized*
first line (bullet marker stripped, markdown emphasis markers stripped,
whitespace collapsed, lowercased). This key is embedded in the issue body as
an HTML comment marker:

    <!-- effort-key: <sha1 hex> -->

On every run we list existing open+closed issues, extract this marker from
each issue body, and match by key. This means an item's identity survives
the item moving between sections (e.g. Planned -> In Progress -> Completed)
as long as its first line doesn't change wording — which is the normal
lifecycle (state transitions in this codebase's protocol correct rows in
place rather than rewriting them). If the first line DOES change wording,
the old key becomes orphaned (see "Orphans" below) and a new issue is
created; this is an accepted tradeoff of a stateless, board-is-truth design.

Reconciliation
--------------
  - planned, in-progress   -> issue OPEN, label state:planned / state:in-progress
  - completed, deployed    -> issue CLOSED, label state:completed / state:deployed
  - Every mirrored issue always carries the `effort-board` label plus exactly
    one `state:*` label (old state:* labels are removed when the state
    changes).
  - Title = first ~80 chars of the item's first line (bold markers and the
    bullet stripped), truncated on a word boundary with "...".
  - Body = the item's full text (all folded lines) + a fixed footer that
    says this is a read-only mirror, plus a link to the board file at the
    commit that produced it.
  - Idempotent: if title/body/labels/state already match, no API call is
    made beyond the initial list. Existing issues are only updated when
    something actually changed.
  - Never deletes issues. An item that disappears from the board (row
    removed/merged into another) leaves its mirrored issue in place,
    untouched, with whatever state it last had — a human can close it
    manually if desired. This script does not guess intent for vanished
    rows.
  - Hand-made issues without the `effort-key` marker are ignored entirely
    (never edited, never closed, never relabeled).

Auth
----
Uses the GitHub Actions-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` (env var, `issues: write`
permission) via the plain REST API (`api.github.com`), stdlib
`urllib.request` only — no GraphQL, no third-party dependencies. Repo is
read from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (e.g. "owner/repo"), which Actions sets
automatically; this makes the script identical across all three repos it
runs in.

Rate limiting
-------------
Bulk creation (e.g. ~100 issues the first time a repo's board is mirrored) can
trip GitHub's *secondary* rate limit: the API 403s with "secondary rate limit
... temporarily blocked from content creation". Three mitigations:

  - Every successful issue creation is followed by a small throttle sleep
    (CREATE_THROTTLE_SECONDS) to stay under the content-creation rate.
  - On a rate-limit response (403/429 with a rate-limit/abuse message or a
    Retry-After header), the request is retried: we sleep Retry-After when the
    server sent one, else exponential backoff. All retry sleeps draw from a
    single bounded per-run budget (RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_BUDGET_SECONDS).
  - If that budget runs out, the run stops early and exits 0 with an explicit
    "partial sync — resume on next run" summary instead of failing. The sync
    is idempotent and board-driven, so the next scheduled/triggered run picks
    up exactly where this one stopped; a red workflow run for an expected
    partial pass would be noise.

Local testing: export GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPOSITORY yourself, then run
`python3 scripts/sync-effort-issues.py [--dry-run]`.
