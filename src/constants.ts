// attribution (see `classifyTickerAlias` / `resolveContinuousTicker` in utils.ts):
//   • TICKER_RENAMES      — same continuous listed entity; the price series simply continues
//                           under the new ticker, so folding old→new is correct for backtests.
//   • TICKER_ACQUISITIONS — the source ticker was delisted in a takeover (cash and/or a
//                           different successor entity); its price series ENDS at the deal, so
//                           folding it into the acquirer's ongoing series fabricates exposure.
// `TICKER_ALIASES` is their union, retained as a flat map for identity/display resolution and
// for backward compatibility with existing consumers that only need the current ticker.

/** Continuous renames/rebrands: same listed entity, price history continues under the new ticker. */

  TWX: "WBD", // Time Warner (TWX) acquired by AT&T 2018 — TWX holders received AT&T (T) stock and TWX's series ended there. WBD is a DOWNSTREAM 2022 entity (AT&T's WarnerMedia spun off + merged with Discovery); curated as the current successor for display, NOT the direct 2018 successor.

 * NOTE: this map is PIT-UNSAFE — it folds acquisition sources (ATVI→MSFT, …) into the acquirer,
 * so point-in-time logic that resolves through it will attribute a delisted position to the
 * acquirer's ongoing price series. Use `classifyTickerAlias()` / `resolveContinuousTicker()`
 * when the corporate-action class matters. Its key enumeration order (renames then acquisitions)
 * is NOT part of the contract — treat it as an unordered lookup map.
